## Hello to all those viewing this page. 

My name is Anderson Chung, and for now, this is where I will be posting updates for the Harker School. Keep in mind that this is purely unofficial, and anything I say/do is not neccesarily condoned by the admins at the harker school.

### Basic Situation

The Harker Middle School, currently located at 3800 Blackford Ave, San Jose, CA 95117 closed on Thursday, March 12, 2020, as a direct result of the COVID-19 Outbreak.

# Some Basic Facts
- the country of Taiwan, with a population of around 23 million, can produce 
nearly 13 million N95 medical grade face masks a day, totalling 273 million a
month.

- the US can make around 90 million a month, _and_ continues to discourage the
use of masks.

- Covid-19 can travel by air, water, insects, and can also stay up to 9 days 
alive on surfaces.

- Social distancing measures put in place do help, although 6 feet is
_minimal._

- New studies show that a sneeze can travel as far as 27 feet, as far as a 
4-lane freeway.

- Also, don't be a jerk on the road. Cars, contrary to popular belief, 
_do not_ need to maintain social distancing, so keep on driving normally 
and don't be paranoid for no reason.

Dearest Diary,
    Today I learned a lot in school-- We started Chapter 11 in math, I received a summa cum laude in the NLE and the Monday Meeting was, nevertheless mundane, as usual. One thing, no, actually many things made today different than any other day:
    1. Zoom (ZM) rose 9.16% in a day, earning me some 75 USD, while the tech giant Amazon (AMZN), soared 6.17%, bringing my total to about +300USD.
    2. My Rapid rating on lichess.org rose by around 225 points-- its because I was underrated to start with
    3. I stubbed my toe.

Exactly a month before today, I went to school with a facemask , and a girl in my class laughed at me and told me in a very cocky, matter-of-fact voice that 'they don't work because the US surgeon general said so.' In fact, what she had just said contradicted itself. The US surgeon general had made a public statement earlier that day saying for the US population not to buy masks because 'the healthcare workers need them the most'. If they dont work, why the fuck would the medical workers need them? Also, where the crap do these hospitals get their masks? Target?

I'm going to make this one short, as I don't have much time. Today I was finally proud of the US for making some right decisions. They announced that masks do help. Yay! Proceeding that sentence came the sentence, "please do not purchase medical masks because they are supposed to be for medical workers." That, I guess I can understand. People should not go out anyways, regarldless of whether or not they have a mask. The CDC then posted a video titled _how to make your own mask at home_, to which I responded "BULLSHIT." So now, on top of everything else, you have these retards walking around with their own masks they created at home, feeling like they are invincible and can do whatever the fuck they want, _just because of the fact they created their own bandana_.
